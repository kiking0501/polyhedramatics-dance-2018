### The Exhibition.

This artwork is featured in *The City Art Exhibition*, from 3 to 30 September 2018, at the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts.  

<br>

### The Motivation.

This is a collaborative work with Hippocates Cheng, a Hong Kong composer and an overtone singer. In April 2018, we discussed the potential of ***exploring mathematical beauty in music***. He shared his composed music score *“Concerto for Orchestra: What Could I Leave for the World”* with me, and I decided to ***visualize this piece of music with its underlying mathematical beauty***  through animation. 

<br>

### The Artwork.

The final animation, however, goes beyond mathematical beauty and becomes much of an artwork out of *imaginary, fantasy*, and ***my obsession over Polyhedra*** in the mathematical geometry context. It can be seen as a continuation work of my exhibition <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/ShiningBeautyofMaths" target="_blank">*璀璨數學之美 Shining Beauty of Mathematics* </a> back in year 2016 in CUHK. This time, however, instead of creating scriptures of polyhedra, I decide to bring the polyhedra to live and ***dance*** according to their internal coherence with the music rhythm.  This animation is about the ***dramatics*** between ***polyhedra***. As such, it is named ***"Polyhedramatics - The Dance"***.

### This repository

#### Animation
Making animation is completely exploratory as it is my first time doing so. Finally, I came across the solution **THREE.js** , which is a cross-browser Javascript Library and API used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web- browser. Learning much from the <a href="https://threejs.org/examples" target="_blank"> library's official examples </a>, I was able to ***program*** the unrealistic scenes that flash on my mind while I was reading the music score and listening to the music piece . 

<br>

This repository is all the code that creates the animation. The code was much messy, but the result is fantastic (check <a href="https://kiking0501.github.io/polyhedramatics-dance-2018/src/polyhedramatics/main.html" target="_blank">this link</a> and click the "Play" button). My highest gratitude to WebGL!
